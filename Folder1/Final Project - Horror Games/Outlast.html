      <h2>Welcome to the Terrifying World of Outlast</h2>
      <p>Dare to Enter:
      Step into the shoes of Miles Upshur, a fearless freelance investigative journalist,
      as he embarks on a spine-chilling journey into the heart of Mount Massive Asylum.
      Nestled in the remote mountains of Lake County, Colorado, this dilapidated psychiatric hospital holds secrets that are begging to be uncovered… if you’re brave enough.
      </p>
      <h2>Gameplay That Keeps You on the Edge</h2>
      <p>Survive the Horror:
      Outlast redefines survival horror with a simple yet profound rule: run, hide, or die. With no weapons at your disposal,
      your only hope is to navigate the eerie corridors of the asylum using stealth and cunning. Hide in lockers, duck under beds, and use your wits to avoid the homicidal inhabitants lurking around every corner.
      </p>
      <h2>A Visual Experience Like No Other</h2>
      <p>See Through the Darkness:
      The darkness of Mount Massive Asylum is all-consuming, but your trusty camcorder’s night vision mode pierces through the blackness.
      Remember, batteries are scarce, and every flicker of light counts. Will you risk the safety of the shadows to search for more power, or will you navigate the terrifying darkness with what little you have?
      </p>
      <h2>The Legacy of Outlast</h2>
      <p>A Horror Phenomenon:
      Since its release, Outlast has terrified millions, becoming a cult classic in the horror genre.
      Its success has spawned sequels and even a comic book series, expanding the horrifying universe Red Barrels has created. Join the community of fans who have experienced the terror and lived to tell the tale.
      </p>
      <h2>Join the Adventure</h2>
      <p>Are You Ready?
      Outlast is not just a game; it’s an experience that tests the limits of your fear. Are you prepared to uncover the truth behind Mount Massive Asylum? Grab your camcorder, and let’s dive into the nightmare together.
